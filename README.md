Exploring the PMP cell line data

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to explore the PMP cell line data using the skills gained in the STAT540 course.

## Workflow
* exploration_2.Rmd: Identify cell line samples of interest, develop hypothesis  
  - Save: `exprs` (mRNA-seq tpms) and `libs` (metadata)  
* expression_analysis.Rmd: Starting from saved `exprs` and `libs`, perform RNA-seq data analysis learned in STAT540...
